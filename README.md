# Code Test

## Goal
Try to do as much as possible on the front-end part (as discussed earlier) involving creating a responsive dynamic UI which will be a replica of the psd file provided.

## Process
* Tried to create a replica of the psd file provided.
* Inserted a chartJS "dougnut" pie.
* Inserted the display of the pizza thumbnails.
* Inserted the range sliders.
* Designed and tweaked the layout.
* Styled, added eventlisteners and functions all along.
* Spent a lot of time fixing errors

I decided to customize the UI by adding a button to display the pizza thumbnails. My main focus was to make the functionalities work and overcome diverse incompatibilities between different technologies.

## Wins

* Created a loop to display the datas + addEventListener button.
* Added and made the range sliders responsive.
* Customized the range sliders.
* Created function to display text from the input, above the chart.
